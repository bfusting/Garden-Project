The client is the Homeowner Association of Arden which would like to preserve the forest lines of the neighborhood. To do this the client would like native plants to Delaware to be utilized as well as a variety of plants from shrubs to trees.

Client would like the following features:
User can identify plant characteristics to narrow plant selection, e.g. light, water, bloom time, food, bloom color, soil requirements
User is given a menu of plants from which to drag onto the garden area (top view)
Plants have bloom, non-bloom, and winter images (these may be shaded ovals/circles); images must appear correctly sized relative to the garden and other plants. User can view garden at different times and images will change.
Land surrounding garden can be labeled (e.g. woods, lawns)

Features we will implement:
Hover to see plant information (bloom time, Latin name, water requirements, animals fed, etc)
Light, Bloom time, water requirements are entered by user as preferences
Add features such as rocks, paths, etc
Save/load garden
